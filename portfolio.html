    <p>The BEST pizza! New Haven style! An interactive website for pizza lovers, college students, tourests and anyone who has not had the opportunity to try the best pizza. The website will be hyperlink ready where it will take you to the top 3 places in New Haven, CT along with a few others on the map tab. This website is geared to provide the restaraunt information such as location on a map, address, and contact number in an easy as a click on th map. You can rate and submit comments. As well as provide feedback to the developer.</p>
    <p>I used JS and Jquery to create the restaurant names, comment section and interaction for the user to vote using pizza slices. When the user selects each empty slice, it wil change to a colored "full" slice of pizza. The user can select as many as he or she would like to vote on their favorite place or leave a comment about each place. The rating is stored in local storage.
